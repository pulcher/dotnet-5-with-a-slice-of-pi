Can you run .NET 5 Raspberry Pi?  Yes you can! As well as, most of the popular Linux distros.
In this presentation I will go over how to get started.  Some of the recommended ways to build, deploy, 
publish, and even debug those applications on Linux.  Running software is great, but 
with my IoT focus we will have some hardware involved as well!  Come hang out with me
and I hope to inspire every on to give this stuff a try!
