Can you run .NET Raspberry Pi?  Well, yes you can!  This not just for Raspberry Pi's!
Almost any of the popular Linux distros are supported as well.  In this presentation
I will go over how to get started.  The some of ways to build, deploy, publish, and 
even debug those applications on Linux.  Console and web applications are nice, but 
with my IoT focus we will have some hardware involved as well!  Come hang out with me
and I hope to inspire to give this stuff a try!
