Harold Pulcher is a Microsoft MVP, co-ambassador for Hackster.io, developer, network engineer, magician, woodworker, 
and a part time grease monkey. He has over 30 years of experience working in Information Technology. During that 
time he has done everything from running network cable, setting up various companies infrastructure from the 
absolute bare metal, and building line of business software for many of those companies. As passionate as 
he is about technology, you might happen to see him checking his air reserve while at a depth of 60 feet, cooking up 
a mean "free-range" fruit cake, doing pre-show table magic at the improv, or making a nice piece of wood 
into a lot of sawdust so my wife will have potting bench for her plants.
